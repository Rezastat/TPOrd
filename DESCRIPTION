Description: TPOrd provides a comprehensive suite of tools for the design and analysis 
    of two-phase studies with ordinal outcomes. The package includes functions for simulating 
    ordinal data, implementing both baseline and optimal sampling strategies, and estimating 
    parameters using a semiparametric likelihood method and the EM algorithm. 
    Other features include genetic algorithm-based optimal sampling designs and 
    support for cumulative logit, adjacent category, and stopping ratio models.
