In this folder, you will find the simulation files for the adjacent category logit model. To run simulations for different models, follow these instructions:

For Cumulative Logit Model:
  - Set `model_type` to `"Proportional_Odds"`.
  - Set `fam` to `propodds(reverse = FALSE)`.

For Stopping-Ratio Logit Model:
  - Set `model_type` to `"Stopping_Ratio"`.
  - Set `fam` to `sratio(reverse = FALSE, parallel = TRUE)`.

The specific simulation files are as follows:

- `adcat_sim.R`: Generates simulations based on SRS and Y-Bal strategies and analyzes them.
- `adcat_R3R4.R`: Generates simulations based on Z-Bal and YZ-Bal strategies and analyzes them.
- `adcat_R5678data.R`: Generates simulations based on Best-SRS, GA-Y-Bal, GA-Z-Bal, and GA-YZ-Bal strategies.
- `adcat_R5678.R`: Analyzes the simulations generated by `adcat_R5678data.R`.
